# Midnight SMP Modpack
Midnight SMP has a basic modpack that aims to enhance the vanilla experience while maintaining the vanilla feel. It adds optimizations, visual enhancements, most Optifine features, and a few extra things. The pack is broken into 4 modules that you can pick and choose from. You can find a spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/111PN7tWLVby8YNLiPazWKl4AGu4Rl9VqFtxK6HEfoSI/edit?usp=sharing) that explains the function of each mod in the pack(s) so you can easily remove features you don't like.
## Optimization
This module's sole purpose is making the game run as smoothly as possible. It doesn't add any extra features that don't optimize the game.
## Visual Enhancement
This module aims to make the game prettier and add feature parity with Optifine. It adds resource pack features, particle enhancements, capes, shaders, and more!
## Quality of Life
This module adds various quality of life improvements, such as better menus and social features.
## Extra Features
This module has the biggest changes to gameplay, including freecam, WorldEdit (for the creative server), proximity voice chat, and maps.
## Full Pack
If you want to use the complete pack (all 4 modules), install this.
